2. Why is habitat fragmentation thought to be negatively correlated with biodiversity?
3. Jargon check: what is compositional and configurational heterogeneity?
4. How are environmental heterogeneity and habitat fragmentation related to each other?
5. What is niche width and how does it impact how a species might respond to increased envirinmental heterogeneity?
6. What is dispersal range and how does it impact how a species might respond to increased environmental heterogeneity?
