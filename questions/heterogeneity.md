title: Heterogeneity Questions
---
* What are the different scales of environmental heterogeneity discussed in Frankenpaper?
    * How have we been thinking about environmental heterogeneity in this class before today?
* How do we think environmental heterogeneity at these different scales influences biodiversity?
* How does ecology actually quantify environmental heterogeneity? Do you think we're doing it in ways that reflect how we think about it conceptually?
* Does the meta-analysis support the idea in our field about the relationship between environmental heterogeneity and biodiversity?
* One of the things landscape ecology studies is role of the configuration of the landscape. What is in the perspective of the landscape that is missing from the ways environmental heterogeneity is being quantified in the studies Stein et al compiled?
* Why might this aspect of environmental heterogeneity be important?
* How are area and heterogeneity related?
* Why is the niche width of a species important for understanding how biodiversity responds to increasingly complex environments?
