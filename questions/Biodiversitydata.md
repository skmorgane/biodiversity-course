Biodiversity research requires biodiversity data. The goal of reading this paper is to 
inspire you to think about how ecology has been collecting data, how it influences what questions we can ask, 
and what limits it sets on the breadth of our scientific inferences.

1. How is the word 'biodiversity' being applied here? What aspects of biodiversity does this not include?
2. I want you to think about the data they are using. What is it? How would you describe it? 
3. What does it take to collect this type of data?
4. What are the strengths and weaknesses of this data? Are there limits to what we can say with it?
5. What does their map of where their data was collected say about our current biodiversity knowledge?
6. What do you think the data in this paper captures well and what do you think it may miss?
7. If you would add a caveat to their title, what would it be?
8. Ideally what type of data would we have to ask their question?
