title: Hotspots
---

*Global hotspots of species richness are not congruent with endemism or threat
    * What is an endemic species?
    * What do we mean by a 'hotspot'? 
    * What are the types of hotspots they are using in this paper, specifically? Why are they using these three measures of hotspots?
    * Where are the hotspots generally concentrated? Why might that be?
    * How congruent were the different types of hotspots?
    * Were you surprised by any of the results?
    * What do the authors suggest might be behind the differences in the patterns of species richness vs endemic richness? Can you think of other possible mechanisms for the lack of congruence between the three hotspot definitions?
    
* The Influence of Late Quaternary Climate-Change Velocity on Species Endemism
    * What is climate-change velocity? How are they defining it here?
        * What scales (and processes at these scales) are they capturing with this measurement?
        * Would a 1 degree change in temperature have the same climate-change velocity everywhere?
    * What impact should high climate-change veolcities have on species?
        * In particular, how does dispersal influence the impact?
    * How do global patterns of endemism relate to global patterns of climate-change velocity?
    * Think back to the patterns in the first paper - given this paper, would you expect species richness hotspots and endemism hotspots to be in the same locations?
