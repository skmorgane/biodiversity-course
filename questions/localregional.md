title: Local-Regional Diversity

Questions for Coyle et al:

* What are core species? What factors should primarily influence core species?
* What are transient species? What factors should primarily influence transient species?
* Why have there been so few studies examining whether core and transient species are actually influenced by different factors?
* How do they suggest different mechanisms can lead to similar levels of species richness?
* Are transient species the same as rare species? Why or why not?
* This paper does not deal with functional or phylogenetic diversity, but it doesn't mean the core-transient concept has no relevance for understanding functional and phylogenetic diversity. How might your analyses of functional and phylgenetic diversity be impacted if your community has a high number of transient species?
