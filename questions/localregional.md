Questions for Ricklefs
* Ricklefs proposes that local deterministic processes make what 3 common predictions? Why these are the expectations from local processes (i.e. what are the mechanisms/processes that would result in those outcomes?)
* What concept(s) does Ricklefs argue has gotten lost in diversity research?
* What is the key concept Ricklefs point to that community ecologists use to assume that local biodiversity processes ware separate from regional diversity processes?
* What does Ricklefs suggest that Figures 2 and 3 demonstrate about local and regional processes?
* How does Ricklefs propose ecology expand its focus from predominately local processes? 
* Do you think Ricklefs has made appropriate assumptions about how local deterministic processes might influence the three hypotheses he goes through? Why or why not?

Questions for Hulbert and White (feel free to skip the autocorrelation part unless it is of interest to you)
* What do White & Hurlbert argue has been a missing component in the debate over local vs. regional control of local community richness?
* What is variance partitioning? How do they use it to push address what they think is missing in the local-regional debate?
* What are the local variables they exmaine? What are the regional variables?
* How do local and regional variables relate to local diversity?
* At what time scales do local or regional variables have their strongest signal? Why?
* How do they propose local and regional processes are combining to determine local richness?
