title: Local-Regional Diversity

Questions for Hurlbert and White (feel free to skip "Spatial Scale, Autocorrelation, and Pseudoreplication" section in discussion)

* The paper focuses on the debate about whether local richness is better explained by local processes or regional processes. 
    - What are the local processes that are hypothesized to limit local richness?
    - how does regional richness potentially influence local richness? 
* What do White & Hurlbert argue has been a missing component in the debate over local vs. regional control of local community richness?
* What are the local variables they exmaine? What are the regional variables? How do these variables relate to the HilleRisLambers et al model of processes that we've been talking about all semester?
* How do they propose local and regional processes are combining to determine local richness?

Questions for Coyle et al:

* What are core species? What are transient species? 
* What factors should primarily influence core species? What about transient species? Why?
* Why have there been so few studies examining whether core and transient species are actually influenced by different factors?
* How do they suggest different mechanisms can lead to similar levels of species richness?
* Are transient species the same as rare species? Why or why not?
* What are the challenges to accurately determining to which group a species belongs?
* This paper does not deal with functional or phylogenetic diversity, but it doesn't mean they aren't relevant to this concept. How might your analyses of functional and phylgenetic diversity be impacted if your community has a high number of transient species? 
* Is there only one way of being a transient species or could different processes produce different ways of being a transient?
