#### Questions for Petchey and Gaston: Functional diversity (FD), species richness and community composition
* What is functional diversity?
* What is different between functional diversity and taxonomic diversity?
* Why isn't it enough to just study taxonomic diversity?
* To explore the approach discussed in Petchey and Gaston, we'll work through a really trivial toy example. After reading the Intro and Methods, see if you can do the following:
     We have a 5 species community and 1 trait (a length measurement of some sort. You can think of it as whatever length measurement might apply to you taxon of choice
     Species A: 10 units
     Species B: 11 units
     Species C: 13 units
     Species D: 13.5 units
     
     
    A. Make the S matrix
    
    B. Make the D matrix (for your distance metric, just take the absolute value of the difference between two species).
     
    C. Let's assume when we put your D matrix through the clustering algorithm (we'll talk in class about how these work sincePetchey and Gaston don't go into much detail here) and you get the dendrogram below. Use your intuition to place each of the species on this dendrogram

    D. Assume each individual vertical bar equals a branch length of 5. (i.e. a vertical line consisting of 2 vertical bars = 10). What is the functional diversity of this community?
 
* Examine figure 2. Petchey and Owen run simulations where they change the shape of the dendrogram.
     * What does changing the shape of the dendrogram represent?
     * What effect does this have on the relationship between functional diversity and the number of species in your community?

* What is phylogenetic diversity?


* Given what you know about phylogenys how would you apply this to measure phylogenetic diversity?

* Think about this approach and compare to what was done in the Kraft et al. paper
from last week. Can you calculate alpha, beta, and/or gamma diversity using the Petchey
and Gaston approach? Why or why not?
