Biodiversity Ecosystem Function 

The Biodiversity-Ecosystem research area has been an extremely active area of biodiversity research for the past 20 years. It has also been highly controversial. These three papers give an overview of what this field has found (Cardinale et al), where many people feel like it should be going (Reiss et al), and what is currently being done (Mestre et al).
Today’s discussion is going to integrate across these paper so we can discuss what we think the Biodiversity-Ecosystem Function research program is showing and how this fits into the patterns and processes we’ve discussed thus far.
* Let’s make sure we’re all on the same page first. Cardinale et al is a meta-analysis on nearly 10 years of studies examining the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem function.
    * In this paper, they use highly controlled experimental studies that include information about how species perform in monoculture and polycultures of different levels of diversity. Why are biodiversity-ecosystem function studies done this way? (You may need to piece this together using information from the Reiss et al paper).
    * We’ve discussed how biodiversity is a complicated concept. How is this word being used in this study? 
    * Is there a general relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem function? 
* Using Cardinale et al and Reiss et al., what are the two general types of processes that can generate higher ecosystem function with higher richness? How do these relate to the processes we’ve talked about thus far? (Biotic and abiotic filters, coexistence theory, stochastic processes).
* What do Reiss et al think the future of Biodiversity-Ecosystem Function research should be? How does it compare to the body of work Cardinale et al are analyzing and interpreting?
* The Mestre et al paper represents one of the new branches of biodiversity-ecosystem function research. 
    * What is new about it in comparison to studies in Cardinale et al? 
    * Does this reflect the Reiss et al vision?
* You are a biodiversity expert in training: given what we’ve discussed in class thus far, what aspects of this research program do you like and what do you think would be a productive path forward?
