Questions for Gill et al.

* Of the three major things they talk about in this paper (aka the things they list in the title), what do Gill et al. suggest is the causal relationship between them? 
* What type of data do they use to figure out the causal relationship? How?
* What do they mean by no-analog communities?
* What are the two other hypotheses for causal relationships that they rule out? Why do they suggest that they can be ruled out?
* Are there other parts of the world that might have experienced some type of analagous change, perhaps in the less distant past or currently?
* What does this mean for our modern world as we enter a possible "sixth mass extinction"? Will we see the similar effects? Why or why not?


Questions for the abstract (Boyer & Jetz)

This paper offers another perspective on how extinctions can impact ecosystems, this time focusing on the loss of functional groups. I want you to use this abstract as a springboard for thinking about how extinctions can impact the world we see around us. They mention the loss of certain functional groups potentially impacting humans. What might they be talking about? How are extinctions (or potential extinctions) affecting the world more broadly today?

Now let's flip these questions a bit. In addition to thinking about how extinctions are potentially impacting humans, how are human-dominated landscapes affecting extinction risks today? Think about the processes (at local, regional and global levels) that we've talked about throughout the semester. What are the potential anthropogenic effects on them? What does that mean for biodiversity?
