#### Questions and Guidance for for Kraft et al. Disentangling the Drivers of 
#### Beta Diversity Along Latitudinal and Elevational Gradients

If the study of biodiversity patterns is new for you, this first paragraph may 
not make a lot of sense. Don't panic. Because it is a short paper, it is not
taking the time to explain jargon and concepts. By the end of the semester, this 
paragraph will be a lot more comprehensible. The questions I'm going to ask will 
on the aspects of the paper I want you to think about. If you don't know the
answer, what is your best guess? Remember, being wrong in this class does not
result in points taken away. 

* What is a diversity gradient? Which ones are the specific ones being
studied here?
* Diversity gradients are often of general interest in ecology, why do you 
think that is? What do diversity gradients tell us?
* what are alpha, beta, and gamma diversity?
* What are the two scales that could be driving these diversity gradients and how 
do alpha, beta, and gamma relate to them?
* I want you to think a moment about beta diversity. To do so, think about these two scenarios:
    * Given the same landscape, would you expect a dispersal limited group to have higher beta diversity or lower beta diversity than a group of species that are good dispersers? Why?
    * Given the same landscape, how would you expect beta diversity to be different if that area had a large vs a small species pool?
* We often have an intuitive feel for alpha,beta,gamma, but quantifying them is sometimes tricky.How do they measure alpha, beta, and gamma diversity in this paper?
* Were you surprised at how they measured beta-diversity? Were you expecting
a different approach? 
* What are the 2 ways that they explore for calculating beta diversity? They tell you
slightly different information - what is that difference?
* What makes beta diversity complicated to interpret?
* How do they try to deal with this problem with beta diversity?
* They make a brief statement in the main text about the size of the plots. In
the supplemental materials (where the methods are) they say this:
"As emphasized in the main text, the spatial scales at which we defined 
Î±- and gamma -diversity are smaller than typically have been used in the literature; this is a limitation of the data that are available.  However, the sampling issues that we explore here are general and not dependent on the scales used, particularly when the number of individuals in a local 
community is small." Why do we need to think about the number of individuals
we've sampled when thinking about measuring diversity? (think about pulling marbles from
a jar)
* After reading the paper, what are some of the concepts or ideas that were
new to you?
