Biodiversity Ecosystem Function 

Class Instructions: 
The Biodiversity-Ecosystem research area has been an extremely active area of biodiversity research for the past 20 years. I'll give a brief mini-lecture on the background of this research area in class and then we will discuss what I think are fun emerging directions for this research area. After I give the minilecture, we will break into groups based on paper to answer some quetions I will give you class that will ask you to identify what is novel about the paper you chose to read based on the background I gave in class. Then we will discuss everyone's insights in the main group.
