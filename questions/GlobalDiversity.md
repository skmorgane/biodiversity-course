title: Global Diversity
---

* We haven't talked a lot about phylogenetic and functional diversity in a while. Let's start with some review:
   * Group 1- What is phylogenetic diversity and what kind of information does it tell us about biodiversity?
   * Group 2 -What is functional diversity and what kind of information does it tell us about biodiversity? 
* Figure 1 shows possible relationships between FD and PD and is also a partial review of patterns we talked about earlier in the semester. 
   * Group 3 - What is overdispersion and what do we think it means ecologically?  
   * Group 1 - Figure 1 has a 'deficit' region labelled. What does it mean and what does it reflect ecologically?
   * Group 2 -Explain what the phylogenetic constraint space represents 
* Group 3 - What were the observed patterns between species richness, PD, and FD?
* All groups - Did continents differ in their observed phylogenetic/functional diversity relationship? What do you think this means?
* All groups - What were the differences in patterns between the temperate and tropical regions? What did they suggest explained that difference? What do you think?
