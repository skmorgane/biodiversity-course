Reading instructions: We're going to use this paper as a jumping off point for talking about how
earth history and evolutionary processes combine to generate biogeographic-scale diversity. Unlike our
other 'process' focused papers, this paper is very focused on understanding a specific place. We're
going to use talking about a specific place, along iwth the knowlegdge we've built up over this
semester, to talk about evolution in the context of generating biodiversity.
