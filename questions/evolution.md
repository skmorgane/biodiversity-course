title: Evolution
---

Reading instructions: We're going to use this paper as a jumping off point for talking about how
earth history and evolutionary processes combine to generate biogeographic-scale diversity. Unlike our
other 'process' focused papers, this paper is very focused on understanding a specific place. We're
going to use talking about a specific place, along iwth the knowlegdge we've built up over this
semester, to talk about evolution in the context of generating biodiversity. 

* First, let's make sure we're all on the same page with biogeography/evolution jargon (if you
don't know these terms, I recommend googling them before you start reading): 
    * what is diversification? 
    * What is allopatry? 
    * WHat is vicariance?
    * What is a "disjunct distribution"?
* Paragraph 2 of the introduction walks through the various events that people have proposed 
to explain the higher diversity of the Andes. While the introduction mentions these events, it does 
not explain why these events could have generated higher rates of diversification in the Andes. In conjunction 
with Figure 3, think about why these events might have generated opportunities for speciation
    * Final uplift of the Andes
    * Pleistocene climate change
    * formation of sky islands
* What is a biogeographical region? What is are we often assuming about the species from the 
same biogeographical region?
* In the section, "Geographic barrers and events of isolation and diversification", do they find 
that there are geographic locations where allopatric speciation tend to occur? 
* Do the speciation events seem to all happen at the same time?
* The introduction laid out different scenarios that could have generated high diversifiation rates
in the Andes. Do the authors think that one of these scenarios explain all their patterns?
* It's easy to think: oh, evolution, it involves really distinct processes from ecology. But I 
want you to think about the events being described in this paper. They relate to things we've been
talking about all semester. I want you to think about the parallels between the processes that promote
diversification and the ecological processes we've been talking about this semester that drive
ecological biodiversity patterns.
