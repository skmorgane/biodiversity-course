#### Questions for Stability of Ecological Communities and the Architecture of Mutualistic and Trophic Networks

* Why have differences between mutualism and trophic networks been hard to understand?
* We use a variety of terms to describe network structure. What do: modularity, connectance, and nestedness mean? (The little diagrams associated with Figure 3b can help with the latter two terms).
* Did the networks they designed retain their initial structure or did they change over the simulations? What happened and why?
* How did modularity and nestedness impact the stability of the networks?
* Let's revisit our previous discussion on biotic filters and coexistence theory. Does this paper expand or alter your thoughts about biotic filters and how they operate to determine local biodiversity?
