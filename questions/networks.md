title: Class 11 Questions

Use both readings to help answer these questions:

* What is an ecological network?
* Compare and constrast this way of studying communities with those we have talked about thus far. What is similar? What is different?
* We use a variety of terms to describe network structure. These papers discuss mention three of them: modularity, connectance, and nestedness. What do each of those terms describe about network structure?
* How might the structure of a foodweb influence how it responds to a perturbation?
* What is interaction strength? How does it influence how perturbations spread through networks?
* Think about the types of data that would be required to study empirical networks. How would you collect it? Would it be easier for some taxa/ecosystems/interaction types than others? Why?
* Ecological networks often on species. Do traits or phylogeny play a role in ecological networks?
