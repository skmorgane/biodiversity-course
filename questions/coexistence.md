title: Coexistence Theory
---
Instructions: The main parts of this paper that I want you to focus on are Section 1 (INTRODUCTION), Section 2 (CONTEMPORARY COEXISTENCE THEORY AND COMMUNITY ASSEMBLY), and the subsection of Section 3 titled "Trait-Phylogeny-Environment Relationships" (Sections 3.2, 3.2.1, 3.2.2, 3.2.3).

1. What is community assembly and what does it have to do with biodiversity?
2. Let's spend a little time thinking about Figure 1. This is an important figure that explains a lot about how we currently think about communities. Think about the different arrows and labels on this figure. What do they mean and how are they determining what is in a local community?
3. What is coexistence theory? What is its goal or focus?
4. Figure 3 is another important figure. It pulls together all the concepts of coexistence theory. 
    * what is the big difference between the 3 species in panel b)
    * what does this mean about their niches and overlap in resource use?
    * what is panel a) showing us?
    * if you have not been exposed to R* theory before, panel d) is probably a mystery to you, so ignore it for the time being and I will talk about this in class.
    * let's focus on panel e). Why does every species have a population growth rate that declines as its frequency (relative abundance) in the community increases?
    * Why does panel e) tell us about which species are able to coexist together?
5. Stabilizing niche differences and relative fitness differences are the two main processes that determine whether two species can coexist. 
    * what types of things can create stabilizing niche differences?
    * why does a large difference in fitness make coexistence harder?
6. Let's put this together conceptually. I have two species with large differences in their relative fitness. To be able to coexist with each other, would they likely need large or small stabilizing niche differences? Why?
7. In the scenario discussed in figure 3, what role do phylogeny and traits play in which species can coexist?
8. What can phylogenetic or trait clustering in communities tell us?
9. What are some of the difficulties of interpreting these patterns?
