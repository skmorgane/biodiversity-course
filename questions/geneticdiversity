Questions for: "An Anthropocene map of genetic diversity"

1) What is intraspecific genetic variation and how is it different from phylogenetic diversity? 
    * Why is intraspecific genetic diversity important?
    * Why is it hard to study at global scales?

2) What patterns of genetic diversity do they report seeing (i.e. with latitude?, special regions?, land-type?)

3) What is the map of ignorance?

4) Spend a little bit thinking about what it might mean that some areas have a higher genetic diversity than others
A) Implications for differences between natural areas and human settlements?
B) Implications for evolutionary responses to climate change?
C) Implications if areas of high genetic diversity are also areas where there are serious conservation concerns
