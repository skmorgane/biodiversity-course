title: Core-Transient Questions
---

Questions for Magurran & Henderson:

*    Think back to how species-abundance distributions are typically constructed (# of species on one axis and # of individuals on the other). What factor do Magurran and Henderson argue helps describe the patterns?
*    What three ways do they show that the division holds? These aren’t particularly intuitive, so spend some time thinking through how these methods demonstrate their point.

Questions for Coyle et al:

*    How do they define the core-transient distinction?
*    What factors should primarily influence core species? What about transient species? Why?
*    What variables went into their models? What classes were they divided into?
*    They run two different variance partitioning analyses. What are they?
*    What does their first variance partitioning analysis show (Fig. 2)? What about the next suite of analysis (Fig. 3)?
*    How do they suggest different mechanisms can lead to similar levels of species richness?
*    What do they suggest are possible challenges to accurately determining to which group a species belongs?
*    Are transient species the same as rare species? Why or why not?


Now that you’ve read both papers, think about the following broader questions:
*    Is there only one way of being a transient species or could different processes produce different ways of being a transient?
*    In the introduction of the paper, Coyle et al. 2013 mention the core-satellite hypothesis. What is the core-satellite hypothesis? How is core-transient different from core-satellite? Do you think the two distinctions are related?
