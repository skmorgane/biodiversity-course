title: Stochastic
---

We're going to use this paper as a starting point for thinking about different types of processes from those we discussed on Tuesday. Niches and competition/predation/mutualism are processes that we talk a lot about in ecology. The processes today are only being broadly discussed in ecology since 2000 (and rarely discussed at the undergraduate level). If you are unclear on the terms or ideas, there is no shame in that - so are a lot of "card-carrying" ecologists. Ask questions!

* What do we mean by the word 'deterministic'?

* What types of processes does Chase describe as deterministic? Why do you think they are considered deterministic?

* When we use the word 'stochastic', what do we mean? (think generally not just in ecology)

* What types of processes does Chase describe as stochastic? Why?

* When does Chase think we should see stochastic processes dominate community assembly? Why do you think this is and do you agree with him?

* We'll talk about priority effects and how they create multiple stable states in class. But think a bit about how the term is being used. What processes does it seem related to (e.g. dispersal, competition, environmental filters, niches?). Is it considered deterministic or stochastic?

* What happened with the simulated drought?

* Let's put last class's readings on environmental and biotic filters together with this week's readings. What is the paper by Chase saying to you about environmental and biotic filters and what can alter how they operate?
