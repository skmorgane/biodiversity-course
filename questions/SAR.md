There are questions also embedded in the SAR Frankenpaper. Answer those as you go along.

In addition, here's a couple of think about more generally:
1) While it is easy to think of the species-area relationship in an abstract way (compare z-values of different sites, etc), the discussions in Frankenpaper about the processes generating the species-area relationship actually pull together a bunch of things we've discussed this semester. Think about what those processes are and how they are interacting to generate the species-area relationship.

2) I chose the second paper so you could see a different branch of thought on the species-area relationship and how it relates to evolution. Losos and Schulter make an argument for how evolution relates to the species-area relationship - what is that argument?
