#### Questions for Cavender-Bares et al
* Last week we spent a lot of time talking about biotic and abiotic (or environmental) filters. Cavender-Bares et al make an argument that we should expect biodiversity patterns from these filters. 
A) What patterns might an abiotic filter create in a community? Why?
B) What patterns might a biotic filter create in a community? Why? (Link this with our discussions about coexistence theory).
C) How does trait evolution impact the pattern of phylogenetic diversity you may see?
* Focus on the first paragraph of the discussion and figure 6. What patterns of biodiversity are they finding in FLorida oaks? Why?
* After reading the paper, what are your thoughts about abiotic and biotic filters in shaping local biodiversity?

#### Questions for Devictor et al Spatial mismatch and congruence between taxonomic, phylogenetic and functional diversity
* What question are Devictor et al trying to address about functional and phylogenetic diversity and how do they compare to the question Cavender-Bares et al were trying to ask?
* Can we use one axis of diversity to represent all axes of diversity? Why or why not?
* What are the protected areas of France protecting?
* Compare how this paper is using and thinking about functional traits relative to how they were discussed/studied in Cavender-Bares et al. How much does deVictor et al talk about what functional traits they are using?
* Given what you learned in the Cavender-Bares et al paper about the relationship between functional and phylogenetic diversity, what things might you want to know to better understand the relationships among phylogenetic, functional, and taxonomic diversity?
