Damschen et al. 2014

-    What are the different types of patches being used in this study? Specifically, what three qualities of the patches differ? (note: I’m not talking about the three types of wind dynamics being affected but the qualities of the patches themselves)
-    Think back to our discussions of space in metacommunities. Is this study spatially implicit or explicit?
-    Think about the ways in which we’ve talked and thought about abiotic features of the landscape and their effects on biodiversity. How does that differ from what the authors demonstrate in this paper?
-    Do the corridors they use match up with how we usually think about corridors and connectivity? 


Rivera-Ortiz et al. 2014

-    This meta-analysis looks at measures of genetic diversity, one type of biodiversity we haven’t spent a lot of time talking about. Come armed with any vocab words you weren’t clear on.
-    What level of genetic diversity are we talking about in this paper? In what other ways can we think about genetic diversity in the context of biodiversity?
-    What 3 things do they state will impact the amount of genetic diversity loss in populations? How would changes in these initial states mediate or exacerbate genetic diversity loss?
-    What is the general response of genetic diversity to fragmentation?
-    How did fragmentation level and the various biological species traits affect genetic diversity in tetrapods? Did any of their findings surprise you?


Take-away:
These two papers are looking at similar over-all topics in very different ways. Which patterns and processes connect them? Which are opposing (or at least not neatly aligned)?
