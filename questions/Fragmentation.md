1) Why would change in connectivity impact biodiversity? (Link your answer with the metacommunity discussion from last week).
2) How do connectivity and corridors apply to the metacommunity concept? Do they modify arrows, change patches, or are they something not easily explained via the simple metacommunity models?
3) What are extinction debts and colonization credits? Why do they occur?
4) What was in the impact of corridors in this system?
5) At the end they talk vaguely about impacts of corridors on community assembly and biodiversity, though they don't really explore what those are. Given your knowledge about the processes structuring biodiversity, what are some of the differences you might expect between a set of fragments connected by corridors vs a set of identical isolated fragments? Think not only about taxonomic diversity, but also phylogenetic and functional diversity.
