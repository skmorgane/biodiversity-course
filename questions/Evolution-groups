    First, let's make sure we're all on the same page with biogeography/evolution jargon (if you don't know these terms, I recommend googling them before you start reading):
        Group 1- what is diversification?
        Group 1 - What is allopatry?
        Group 2 - WHat is vicariance?
        Group 3 - What is a "disjunct distribution"?
    Paragraph 2 of the introduction walks through the various events that people have proposed to explain the higher diversity of the Andes. While the introduction mentions these events, it does not explain why these events could have generated higher rates of diversification in the Andes. In conjunction with Figure 3, think about why these events might have generated opportunities for speciation
        Group 1 - Final uplift of the Andes
        Group 2 - Pleistocene climate change (Group 2)
        Group 3 - formation of sky islands (Group 3)
    Group 2 - What is a biogeographical region? What is are we often assuming about the species from the same biogeographical region? (Group 2)
    
   Group 3 - In the section, "Geographic barrers and events of isolation and diversification", do they find that there are geographic locations where allopatric speciation tend to occur? (Group 3)
   Group 3 - Do the speciation events seem to all happen at the same time? (Group 3)
   Group 2- The introduction laid out different scenarios that could have generated high diversifiation rates in the Andes. Do the authors think that one of these scenarios explain all their patterns? (Group 2)
   
   All groups - It's easy to think: oh, evolution, it involves really distinct processes from ecology. But I want you to think about the events being described in this paper. They relate to things we've been talking about all semester. I want you to think about the parallels between the processes that promote diversification and the ecological processes we've been talking about this semester that drive ecological biodiversity patterns.
