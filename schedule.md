(Updates for Fall 2020 in Progress - as a result the site will be very dynamic for a few days)
Thursdays are often a split between class activity and discussion, thus there are often two topics on those days. Tuesdays are always just discussion. 

IMPORTANT: if Date is followed by 2 asterisks then readings are not yet finalized for that class period. If questions for readings are not yet posted, they will be at least 1 week before reading is discussed.
