(Updates for Fall 2017 in Progress)
Thursdays are often a split between class activity and discussion, thus there are often two topics on those days. Tuesdays are always just discussion. 

IMPORTANT: if Date is followed by 2 asterisks then readings are not yet finalized for that class period. If questions for readings are not yet posted, they will be at least 1 week before reading is discussed.

 * Given our discussions last week about environmental and biotic filters, I want you to think about the impacts of Hurricane Irma on the Carribbean Islands and in South Florida. How might you expect the hurricane to impact environmental and/or biotic filters in the places it landed? Do you think the islands and the florida mainland might respond differently as they recover? Why? Feel free for your "reading" to look at news reports on the Caribbean Island impacts and the effects on south florida. We'll talk about those questions tomorrow.

#### 10. September 21 Productivity-Diversity Debate
For class you will break into small groups to figure out what you think is going on with this debate. Is someone right and someone wrong? Is everyone right or everyone wrong? How do we walk away from a debate like this with a better understanding of what is going on in nature? The first two papers set out the main debate. The second two are short comments about technical and conceptual issues. Make sure to have a firm grasp of the first two papers and you can have a looser grasp of the two short comments. At the end of class we will come back together as a group and see what different groups thought about this debate.
