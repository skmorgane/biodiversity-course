Updated 9/30/2020
Thursdays are often a split between class activity and discussion, thus there are often two topics on those days. Tuesdays are (nearly) always just discussion. 

IMPORTANT: if Date is followed by 2 asterisks then readings are not yet finalized for that class period. If questions for readings are not yet posted, they will be at least 1 week before reading is discussed.
