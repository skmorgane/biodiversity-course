#### **Times and Locations**

Tuesday, Period 7 (1:55-2:45), MCCB 3124

Thursday, Period 7-8 (1:55-3:50), MCCB 3124

#### **Course Objectives**

The goal of this class is to provide students a basic understanding of biodiversity patterns often studied in the field 
of ecology. By the end of the semester, students will:
1)	Have an appreciation of the complexity of the term “biodiversity”
2)	Have a broad understanding of widely studied biodiversity patterns that exist at different spatial and temporal scales
3)	Become familiar with various ecological processes that generate and help maintain biodiversity patterns
4)	Gain experience with approaching and thinking about scientific debates


#### **General Course Structure and Expectations**

This course is designed to provide advanced training for graduate students in a specialized area of ecology. 
This course is a mixture of small lectures, class discussion of primary literature and hands-on experience involving 
some class activities and a major project. While there is some lecturing, class participation, intellectual 
engagement with topics, and discussion participation are the main ways students will learn in this class. 
Tuesdays and (often) the first hour of Thursdays are devoted to lecture and class discussions. You are expected to 
come prepared to discuss the assigned papers. Participation in discussions is a major component in the grade. The second hour on Thursdays are devoted to either class activities or working on group projects. 

#### **Course Grading**

60% of grade will be based on a class project and presentation (330 points), 
40% will be based on class participation in discussion* (220 points, 10 points/class day).

*A written alternative to class participation can be made for those with anxiety about speaking in front of groups - just contact me to let me know you would prefer this option*

#### **Attendance Policy**

Two days can be missed with  no impacts on your grade without the need
to submit make-up work, though we recommend that students attempt any 
missed class activities on their own time because additional class 
activities or discussions may rely on that knowledge. 

Up to 4 additional missed days can be made-up by submitting make-up work.
Class activities can be made-up on the student's time within a week by doing
the activity and submitting the code/data for instructor evaluation. Missed 
discussions can be made up by providing a written summary of the readings 
for the day(s) missed. Written summaries will involve written answers to the 
questions posted for the readings that were missed.

If a student anticpates missing more than 6 class days (i.e. 3 weeks of classes), you
must talk to the instructors beforehand.

#### **Course Materials**

1)	There is not a required or recommended text book for this class
2)	All reading materials are made available through the course schedule. If you are off-campus when you try to access readings, you will need to log in using the [UF VPN](http://www.uflib.ufl.edu/login/vpn.html).
3)	Laptops: On specific days (noted on the course schedule) laptops will be required to participate in basic computational activities.


### **UF Policies**

#### **University Policy on Accommodating Students with Disabilities**

Students requesting accommodation for disabilities must first register
with the Dean of Students Office (http://www.dso.ufl.edu/drc/). The Dean
of Students Office will provide documentation to the student who must
then provide this documentation to the instructor when requesting
accommodation. You must submit this documentation prior to submitting
assignments or taking the quizzes or exams. Accommodations are not
retroactive, therefore, students should contact the office as soon as
possible in the term for which they are seeking accommodations.

#### **University Policy on Academic Misconduct**

Academic honesty and integrity are fundamental values of the University
community. Students should be sure that they understand the UF Student
Honor Code at http://www.dso.ufl.edu/students.php.

#### **Netiquette and Communication Courtesy**

All members of the class are expected to follow rules of common courtesy
in all email messages, threaded discussions and chats. 

#### **Getting Help**

Other resources are available at
http://www.distance.ufl.edu/getting-help for:

-   Counseling and Wellness resources

-   Disability resources

-   Resources for handling student concerns and complaints

-   Library Help Desk support

Should you have any complaints with your experience in this course
please visit http://www.distance.ufl.edu/student-complaints to submit a
complaint.

Most importantly, if you are struggling for any reason please come talk
to me and I will do our best to help.

**Disclaimer:** This syllabus represents the current plans and
objectives. As we go through the semester, those plans may need to
change to enhance the class learning opportunity or to accomodate natural disasters like hurricanes 
(yes, this happened twice one semester). Such changes, communicated clearly, are not unusual and should be expected.
