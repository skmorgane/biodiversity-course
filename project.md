# Class Project Information


## Task

To work collaboratively on understanding an area of biodiversity knowledge and identify the next (research, conservation, regulatory) step needed on that topic.

## Learning objectives

* To work collaboratively to identify and understand an issue that needs to be tackled
* To apply the knowledge of biodiversity being learned in class
* To gain additional depth on a biodiversity topic
* To practive effective communication in science

## Implementation

* A considerable amount of class time will be devoted to the class project. 
    * In-class projects days are to help reduce the out-of-class time load of the project and to make sure that your group has access to me if needed. 
    * If your group would like to do your in-class meeting time out-of-class, that is perfectly fine. Just let me know in advance what your plan is. 
    * If I'm going to conduct an important project discussion at the beginning of in-class project time, I will let you know in advance so you can plan accordingly.
* Small groups of 3-4 people will work together on a class project
* The group will need to identify something we don't understand in the area of biodiversity. This could be related to fundamental scientific questions, pressing conservation needs, societal issues, etc. You just have to make an argument for why the issue you have identified is related to biodiversity. After identifying an issue related to biodiversity, you will work as a group to delve into that issue and identify something we don't yet understand about it (i.e. why hasn't it been tackled/solved yet and what do we need to know/be able to do to resolve it).
* The group will delve into the literature on that topic and synthesize their readings to be able to communicate the following items:
    * What is the topic and why is it important/relevant?
    * What is already known abouth this topic?
    * What don't we know yet and why might it be important?
    * Why don't we know this thing yet?    
   
* Groups will write up their self-guided learning in the format of an introduction for a scientific journal article 

## Deadlines
We will be working all semester on the group projects. This work is broken into 4 stages to help students make gradual progress on the project over the course of the semester.These four stages are: 1) Group Formation, 2) Identifying the challenge your group is tackling, 3) Researching the topic, 4) Writing the Introduction. Deadlines and some milestones are designed to help you make sure you're on track with your group project. For more information on what you need to do, click on the associated link for each item. More detailed information for each milestone/deadline can be found on the course Canvas page

*9/24*: Post on Discussion Board a general topic you are interested in. 

*9/26*: Before class, read the research ideas on the project discussion board and comment on at least two.

*10/1* Finalize Groups: send group member names and topic area keywords to Morgan

9/26-10/18 Work on understanding your topic area and interests - what about your keywords are you interested in better understanding? Why do you think better understanding it is important?

*10/18* Submit an outline of your introduction through Canvas. It's okay if the structure ends up shifting once your role up your sleeves, but if you put thought into the outline it will generally hold up and serve as a useful counterbalance to "blank page syndrome". In addition to aiding you in your writing process, it will help Morgan assess if you have a cohesive idea of your topic and a chance to discuss any concerns with topic choice.

10/19-11/5 Work on understanding the gap in knowledge related to you topic. As you read the literature think about what is known and what is not known. Work on your 2nd and 3rd paragraphs - What is known about your topic? and What don't we know and why might it be important? Remember, this shouldn't be an exhaustive book report on the topic. Pick the things that help the reader understand how the field has been thinking about the topic and set the reader up to understand why not knowing the thing you've identified might be important.

11/5-11/30 Why does the gap in knowledge exist? What would a research paper need to do/have to fill that gap in knowledge? Your group should be trying to understand why this unsolved question/issue exists today. Is there some limitation (data regulations, societal constraints, technology) that has prevented it from being addressed? Answering these questions will lead you to writing your fourth and fifth paragraphs. 

11/30-12/11 Finish writing the introduction. By this point you should have all the pieces (and perhaps some bullet points or drafts).

    What is the topic area and why is it important?
    What do we know about the topic area? What things influence it or explain it?
    What don't know we know  and why might it be important to know it?
    Why don't we know it already?
    Here we... do what to advance our knowledge?
  
*12/11* Submit your introduction!

## Grading

Your grade is based on communicating the information that makes an introduction effective. Have you communicated what the topic area is and why its important? Can the reader understand the current state of understanding on the topic? Is a gap in knowledge well articulated? Has the reason for the gap been explained?
