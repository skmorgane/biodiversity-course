# Class Project Information


## Task

To work collaboratively on identifying a gap in our knowledge about biodiversity and devise a creative plan for addressing it.

## Learning objectives

* To work collaboratively to identify problems that needs to be solves and devise a plan for solving them
* To apply the knowledge of biodiversity that they are gathering in class
* To gain additional depth on a biodiversity topic
* To practive the use of creativity in science

## Implementation

* A considerable amount of class time will be devoted to the class project. 
    * Unless told otherwise, in-class projects days are to help reduce the out-of-class time load of the project and to make sure that your group has access to me if needed. 
    * If your group would like to do your in-class meeting time out-of-class, that is perfectly fine. Just let me know in advance what your plan is. 
    * If I'm going to conduct an important project discussion at the beginning of in-class project time, I will let you know in advance so you can plan accordingly.
* Small groups of 3-4 people will work together on a class project
* The group will need to identify something we don't understand about biodiversity
* The group will need to devise a plan for filling that gap in knowledge
    * plans do not need to be based on what we are capable of doing currently in ecology
    * plans should identify what the ideal data to answer the question would be
    * plans should devise a creative way for obtaining that data
* Groups will present in class their project at the end of the semester
    * Presnetations will need to introduce the audience to the current state of knowledge on their topic
    * Explain clearly what we currently do not understand about that topic
    * Present their idea for how to fill the current gap in knowledge

## Deadlines
9/13: Post on Canvas Discussion Board a general topic you are interested in. 

9/15: Before class, read the research ideas on the project discussion board.

9/21 Finalize Groups: send group member names and topic area to Morgan

9/21-10/20 Work on identifying the gap in knowledge in your topic area that your group thinks is important to address

10/20 Submit Group Topic Gap in Knowledge to Morgan

10/20-11/8 Start thinking about how you will address your question. How will you fill the gap in knowledge you identified.

11/10 Do you have a plan of how you would fill the gap in knowledge? YAY! You're ready to put your talk together! No? You have another class period to work on this.

12/1 DEADLINE! Present your idea!
   * Presentation Length: 15 minute presentation plus 5 minutes for questions
   * Can you give a short overview of your topic area - what is it and why is is important to study
     * E.g. If you're interested in trait clustering in communities, then you should be able to explain why the field has been interested in understanding patterns of trait clustering and what's our current understanding of trait clustering in communities (this last part should/will set you up for the next part).
   * Can you explain clearly what we don't yet understand and why we really need to understand it
     * E.g. what about patterns of trait clustering to we not understand? Why is this gap in our knowledge important? If we can solve this can it help us understand a theory of ecology, design better experiments or conservation policies, or something else?
   * Can you explain why we don't understand this thing yet (what has prevented us from already solving the problem you've identified)
     * E.g. Do we not have enough data? Have we not collected the right type of data to definitively resolve the question? Why do we not have enough data or the right type of data?
   * Can you explain what your plan is for solving this issue and getting us closer to answering the question you've outlined?
     * E.g. this is the part where you get to be creative. Be as practical or impractical as you want. If you think you have a real solution, go for it. If you can figure out how to do it assuming technology that doesn't yet exist or that you could pull off with unrealistic funding levels thats good too. 
   * If you answer yes to all of those questions, then you are ready to go!

## Grading

Grade is in part based on your effort and engagement with the project (as judged through your meetings in class) and in part on your ability to communicate your idea and answer the questions above. 
Your peers will provide feedback on your communication of your idea. Did they understand what you were trying to do? The gap in knowledge well articulated? Did your peers feel like your plan was clear and well explained? I will take their feedback into consideration in grading. Here's the form that everyone will be filling our for the talks:
